                    At Yorkshire Canine Care, we’re delighted to introduce our brand-new Day Care service — designed with your dog’s happiness, health, and well-being at heart.
                    <br><br>
                    Give your dog the perfect balance of adventure, play, and relaxation with our brand-new Day Care service. Designed for busy Owners who want more than just a quick walk, our Day Care is ideal for dogs who thrive on activity, companionship, and countryside freedom.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you have a high-energy youngster, a sociable dog who loves to mix, or simple want peace of mind while you're at work, our service provides a safe, enriching, and fully supervised experience tailored to your dog's needs.
                    <br><br>
                    Day Care offers dogs the physical and mental stimulation they need to stay happy, healthy, and well-balanced. With regular countryside adventures and structured exercise, dogs release energy in a positive way, helping to reduce behaviours linked to boredom or anxiety. They also benefit from safe, supervised social time with other friendly dogs, which builds confidence, supports good manners, and contributes to a more relaxed, well-adjusted pet. And for owners, it brings complete peace of mind — knowing your dog is spending their day in an enriching, caring environment with experienced professionals.
                    <br><br>
                    Your dog’s day begins with a simple drop-off at our home, where we take over and ensure they enjoy a fulfilling, well-managed routine. We head out for at least an hour of countryside walking, running, sniffing, and exploring before returning for supervised play or calm rest time, depending on what each dog needs. Throughout the day, we provide water, comfort, and regular check-ins to make sure every dog feels relaxed and cared for. When you return for collection, your dog will be happily tired and ready to settle in for a cosy evening at home.

                    Our Day Care service provides dependable support and total peace of mind, ensuring your dog is cared for whenever you need it.
                    <br><br>
                    Our Day Care service gives your dog a full, balanced day of exercise, socialisation, and comfort.
                    <br>
                    Each visit includes a minimum one-hour countryside walk where your dog can roam, explore, and enjoy natural enrichment.
                    Back at our home setting, they’ll benefit from supervised playtime with friendly dogs, helping them build confidence and positive social skills.
                    Throughout the day, we make sure every dog has fresh water, rest breaks, and plenty of affection, and we’re happy to follow your usual routines to keep things consistent and reassuring for your pet.

                    To ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all dogs in our care, we ask that:</span><br>
                    Your dog is house trained.
                    <br>
                    Your dog has a good level of recall.
                    <br>
                    Your dog does not show aggression or resource guarding behaviours.
                    <br>
                    Your dog is comfortable walking off lead and socialising with other dogs.
