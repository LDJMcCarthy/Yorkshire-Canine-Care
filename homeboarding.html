                    Always check that your dog’s home boarder is fully licensed by the local council.
                    A licence means the carer has passed checks on <span class="bold">safety, cleanliness, experience, insurance, and animal welfare standards</span> — helping to keep your dog happy, healthy, and secure while you’re away.
                    <br><br>
                    At Yorkshire Canine Care we are proud to be council licensed!
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold">Licence No: 25/00892/COMM</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Your dog deserves care that's not just loving, but officially approved too.

                    At Yorkshire Canine Care, we understand that leaving your dog while you’re away can be a difficult decision.That’s why our home boarding service is designed to give your dog a true home-from-home experience — where they’ll be treated as part of our family from the moment they arrive.
                    <br><br>
                    We have a unique policy of only boarding one dog at a time, or two from the same household. This means your dog receives our full attention, comfort, and care throughout their stay. We take the time to help each dog settle in, ensuring they feel calm, happy, and secure in our home environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Yorkshire Canine Care is fully insured, DBS-checked, professionally qualified, and registered with the local council. We hold the Highest Council Award for our home boarding standards, so you can have complete confidence that your dog is in safe, capable hands.

                    Our Day Care service provides dependable support and total peace of mind, ensuring your dog is cared for whenever you need it.
                    <br><br>
                    Our Day Care service gives your dog a full, balanced day of exercise, socialisation, and comfort.
                    <br>
                    Each visit includes a minimum one-hour countryside walk where your dog can roam, explore, and enjoy natural enrichment.
                    Back at our home setting, they’ll benefit from supervised playtime with friendly dogs, helping them build confidence and positive social skills.
                    Throughout the day, we make sure every dog has fresh water, rest breaks, and plenty of affection, and we’re happy to follow your usual routines to keep things consistent and reassuring for your pet.
